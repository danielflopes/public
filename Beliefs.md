# My beliefs

##On Morality 
- Marriage and adoption by same-sex couples should be legal everywhere.
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere.
- Health care should be available to everyone who needs it.
- Death penalty shouldn't be allowed anywhere.
- Marijuana should be legal to grow, sell, buy, and carry.
- Drug users should be aided for treatment. Not punishment.
- Owning guns for own safety should be allowed only in extreme cases. They give us a false feeling of security.
- Animals shouldn't be used for our amusement in detriment of their well being. This means no to animal fights, part of fur clothing, domestication of exotic animals, and animal circus.

##On Spirituality 
- If there is a God, he created the laws of physics. Everything else is just a consequence.
- Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life.
- Continuously crying over the past and death of others only perpetuates our suffering. We shouldn't ignore our human feelings, but we should strive to think and act rationally. (Stoicism)

##On Science & The Universe 
- It's possible that we live in a simulation.
- Probably there are intelligent non-human life-forms in the Universe.
- We have no cosmic significance. "We are stardust."

##On Health 
- Every food we eat will have a good or bad impact in our (long term) health.
- The more refined the food is, the unhealthier it is.
- There isn't an irrefutable best diet, food, or workout. There is still not enough data to fully understand the consequences of different food, diets and workouts on different human bodies.

##On Technology
- Cars are outdated - they should already be computer-driven. Too many people die in car accidents due to human error.
- Singularity is a possibility, and we are getting pretty close to it. I'm just not sure if we are not going to be extinct before it could happen.

##On the self
- Owning too many things make the things own you.
- Transparency allows us to better connect, become more tolerant, to better focus on what matters, and it's a mean to a better world. But we should take into account other people's feelings when practicing it.
- The only thing that stands in the way of great success are ourselves.

##On Education
- The education system is outdated, and its reformulation is taking too many years.
- Good education is the most efficient way to make the world a better place.

##On Relationships, Love and Sexuality
- Every kind of quality relationship needs time and effort to maintain.
- Sexuality is not black and white (heterosexual or homosexual), but instead various shades of gray.

##Meta
- I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong.
- I'm willing to be convinced that I'm not congruent with my values and beliefs.
- I'm totally ok with you having different beliefs from mine. But I expect you to do the same.
